          Iâ€™m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect
          user interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering.
          My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development,
          creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously
          built for performance and usability.

          Currently, I am dedicating my time and effort to preparing for the
          IELTS exam, focusing on improving my language skills across all
          sections, including listening, reading, writing, and speaking, to
          achieve a high score and meet my goals.

          <br />
          In my spare time, I enjoy reading books on personal growth and
          success, spending time with friends, and playing table tennis to stay
          active. I also dedicate time to coding, creating user-friendly
          websites, and exploring new skills or ideas to keep learning and
          growing.
